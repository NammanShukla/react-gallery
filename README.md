# react-gallery
## A responsive photo gallery webpage using ReactJS

This is the react version of the [photo gallery](https://github.com/NammanShukla/photogallery) app, and will follow the same arguments as the last iteration of the former [photo gallery app](https://github.com/NammanShukla/photogallery).


the already present content is the header and the carousel which can be easily divided into two components and even for the carousel use an npm package instead of hard coding it in the webpage like the last time.
